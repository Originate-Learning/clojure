## [om: Basic Tutorial](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Basic-Tutorial)
> A ClojureScript interface to Facebook's React.
>
> Om allows users to represent their UIs simply as EDN. Because ClojureScript
> data is immutable data, Om can always rapidly re-render the UI from the root.
> Thus Om UIs are out of the box snapshotable and undoable and these operations
> have no implementation complexity and little overhead.



# My Projects
## [Numerical Methods Homework](https://github.com/wmedrano/numerical-methods/)
> #### Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:
>
> 1. Implement a numerical method such as the bisection method, inverse linear
> interpolation or Newton's method to solve a nonlinear equation.
> 2. Implement direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems.
> 3. Construct interpolating polynomials.
> 4. Demonstrate an understanding of quadrature formulas including error
> estimates.
